usage: git cdflow feature start <feature-name>

       git cdflow feature checkout <feature-name>
       git cdflow feature public
       git cdflow feature private

       start    Create a new branch and switch the working tree
                to feature/<feature-name>.

                Example usage:
                git cdflow feature start myfeature

       finish   Switch to parent branch and merge there the current branch.
                The parent branch is the branch that generated the current one
                or the one that has been set with `git cdflow parent set` command.

                Example usage:
                git cdflow feature finish

       checkout Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory.
                In case on origin there are both a private feature branch and a
                public one a menu will ask to the user to select the right one.

       public   Push the current branch on origin: origin/feature/<feature-name>

       private  Push the current branch on origin but on private path:
                origin/private/feature/<feature-name>
